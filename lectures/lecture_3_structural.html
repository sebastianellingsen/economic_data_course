## Quantitative Regional Economics

What governs the *distribution of economic activity* within cities?

First-Nature Geography
- Natural amenities
- Physical geography and endowments

Second-Nature Geography 
- Agglomeration economies 
- Dispersion forces 
- Linkages across locations: Commuting
- The equilibrium between *agglomeration* and *dispersion* determines spatial outcomes  


Understanding these is important in and of themselves, but also important as they mediate the impact of place-based interventions and shocks.

How can we incorporate all these forces into *tractable, quantitative models*?

# A Benchmark Model



---

## Geography

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The model has rich heterogeneity across `\(\mathbb{N}\)` neighborhoods (indexed by `\(i\)` or `\(n\)`).

Amenities: Quality-of-life factors (climate, culture, safety) that influence wages and housing prices.  

Productivities: Agglomeration, knowledge spillovers, and scale effects raise urban productivity and wages.  

Commuting costs: Neighborhoods are connected through coommuting.

Trade is costless within the city (typically the numeraire `\(P_c=1\)`).

Locations differ in their suitability for production and living. 

Agents choose a place to live and a place to work. 


&lt;!-- - pen vs. Closed City: --&gt;
&lt;!--   - *Open City*: Mobile population, utility equalized, wages &amp; rents adjust.   --&gt;
&lt;!--   - *Closed City*: Fixed population, utility varies, shocks absorbed by wages or housing prices. --&gt;





---

## Preferences

There are two goods: a costlessly traded consumption good with price `\(P_n\)` and residential floorspace with price `\(Q_n\)`.

Workers have Cobb-Douglas preferences defined over the two goods 
- Expenditure share on goods given by `\(\alpha\in(0,1)\)`). 

The utility of a worker residing in neighborhood `\(n\)` and working in neighborhood `\(i\)` is
`\begin{equation}
u_{ni}(\omega) = \frac{B_n b_{ni}(\omega)w_i}{\kappa_{ni}P_n^{\alpha}Q_n^{1-\alpha}}
\end{equation}`
- `\(B_n\)` represents residential amenities

- `\(w_i\)` are nominal wages

- `\(b_{ni}(\omega)\)` are idiosyncratic preferences for residence/work neighbrhood pair `\(ni\)`

- `\(\kappa_{ni} = e^{\kappa\tau_{ni}}\)` are iceberg commuter costs where `\(\tau_{ni}\)` is travel time

---



## Neighborhood Residential Amenities

Residential amenities in `\(n\)` depend on location fundamentals `\((\bar{B}_n)\)` and externalities `\((\mathbb{B}_n^{\eta^B})\)`
`\begin{equation}
B_n = \bar{B}_n\mathbb{B}_n^{\eta^B}
\end{equation}`
The externalities take the following form
`\begin{equation}
\mathbb{B}_n = \sum_{i\in \mathbb{N}} e^{-\delta^B\tau_{ni} R_i}
\end{equation}`
- `\(\tau_{ni}\)` again denotes travel time from `\(n\)` to `\(i\)`
- `\(\eta^B\)` denotes the strength of externalities
- `\(\delta^B\)` denotes the rate of decay

This is different than the regional model, but appropriate since the neighborhoods are often very small. 

---



## Idiosyncratic Preferences

 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

`\(b_{ni}(\omega)\)` is drawn from a Fréchet distribution with shape parameter `\(\epsilon\)`
`\begin{equation}
\mathbb{P}\left(b_{ni}(\omega)\leq b\right) = e^{-b^{-\epsilon}}
\end{equation}`
`\(\epsilon\)` governs the variance of the preference distribution and therefore the degree of heterogeneity. 

Larger `\(\epsilon\)` makes the variance lower, making people more sensitive to `\(economic\)` differences across locations. 

Smaller `\(\epsilon\)` increases the spread, making economic differences less important. 

Scale parameter is set to `\(1\)`

We assume that the shock is i.i.d. 



---





&lt;img src="lecture_3_structural_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="864" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;





---

## Commuting Flows

The share of workers living in `\(n\)` and working in `\(i\)` is given by 
`\begin{equation}
\mathbb{P}\left(u_{ni} \geq u_{jk} \forall jk\in \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\right)
\end{equation}`
This probability will equal the share since we have a continuum of agents in each location. 

Using the properties of the Fréchet distribution and that the shocks are i.i.d., it follows that 
`\begin{equation}
\lambda_{ni} = \frac{L_{ni}}{L_{\mathbb{N}}} = \frac{\left(B_n w_i\right)^{\epsilon} \left(\kappa_{ni}P_n^{\alpha}Q_n^{1-\alpha}\right)^{-\epsilon}}{\sum_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\sum_{\ell\in\mathbb{N}} \left(B_k w_{\ell}\right)^{\epsilon}\left(\kappa_{k\ell}P_k^{\alpha} Q_k^{1-\alpha}\right)^{-\epsilon}}
\end{equation}`
The number of people residing in `\(n\)` and working in `\(i\)` depends on the relative attractiveness of the `\(ni\)` pair. 

The sensitivity again depends on `\(\epsilon\)`. 

It follows from this that commuting flows satisfy a gravity equation. 



---

## Residents in Each Location

The fraction of workers who choose to live in a location can be found from `\(\lambda_{ni}\)`:
`\begin{equation}
\lambda_n^R = \frac{R_n}{L_{\mathbb{N}}} = \sum_{i\in\mathbb{N}}\lambda_{ni} = \frac{B_n^{\epsilon}\Phi_n^R \left(P_n^{\alpha} Q_n^{1-\alpha}\right)^{-\epsilon}}{\sum_{k\in \mathbb{N}} \left(B_k\right)^{\epsilon} \Phi_k^R \left(P_k^{\alpha}Q_k^{1-\alpha}\right)^{-\epsilon}},
\end{equation}`
where `\(\Phi_n^R = \sum_{\ell\in \mathbb{N}}\left(\frac{w_{\ell}}{{\kappa_{n\ell}}}\right)^{\epsilon}\)`.

`\(\Phi_k^R\)` denotes the *residence commuter market access*. 

- Summarizes the access to earnings opportunities for a location. 

Cheaper places with better amenities are more attractive to live in.

The higher `\(\Phi_k^R\)`, the more attractive a location becomes because it potentially provides easier access to well-paying jobs. 



---

## Workers in Each Location

The fraction of people who choose to work in a location can also be found from `\(\lambda_{ni}\)`:
`\begin{equation}
\lambda_i^L = \frac{L_i}{L_{\mathbb{N}}} = \sum_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\lambda_{ki} = \frac{ w_i^{\epsilon}  \Phi_i^L  }{\sum_{\ell \in \mathbb{N}} w_{\ell}^{\epsilon}\Phi_{\ell}^L},
\end{equation}`
where `\(\Phi_{i}^L = \sum_{k\in \mathbb{N}} B_k^{\epsilon}\left(\kappa_{ki} P_{k}^{\alpha}Q_{k}^{1-\alpha}\right)^{-\epsilon}\)`

`\(\Phi_k^L\)` denotes the *workplace commuter market access*. 

- Summarizes the access to residential areas in a neighborhood. 

Neighborhoods with higher nominal wages `\(w_i\)` are more attractive to work in.

The higher `\(\Phi_k^L\)`, the more attractive a location becomes for working because you have access to nice places to live. 





---

## Production

 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Production of the final good is done with a Cobb-Douglas technology using labour and floorspace.
- `\(\beta\)` is the labour share.

Perfect competition implies that the unit cost equals the price
`\begin{equation}
1 = \frac{1}{A_n}w_n^{\beta}q_{n}^{1-\beta}
\end{equation}`
where we have imposed `\(P_n = 1\)` for all `\(n\)` (no trade costs, consumption good is the numeraire).

`\(q_{n}\)` is the price of commercial floor space and `\(w_n\)` nominal wages. 




---

## Production Externalities

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The productivity `\(A_n\)` depends on location fundamentals `\((\bar{A}_n)\)` and production externalities `\((\mathbb{A}_n)\)`.
`\begin{equation}
A_n = \bar{A}_n\mathbb{A}_n^{\eta^A}
\end{equation}`
The externalities take the following form
`\begin{equation}
\mathbb{A}_n = \sum_{i\in \mathbb{N}} e^{-\delta^A\tau_{ni}L_i}
\end{equation}`
where `\(\delta^A\)` governs the spatial decay of externalities and `\(\eta^A\)` the overall strength.

Locations closer to many workers have higher productivity. 




---

## Land Market Clearing

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Let `\(v_n\)` denote the per capita income, so `\(v_nR_n\)` is aggregate income in location `\(n\)`. 

Market-clearing for residential requires that the total expenditure on residential floor space equals the payment for its use: 
`\begin{equation}
(1-\alpha) v_nR_n = H_n^R Q_n
\end{equation}`
Assume an absentee landlord, so we can ignore how income is distributed in the baseline model. 

With Cobb-Douglas technology, we also have that 
`\begin{equation}
(1-\beta)w_n L_n = \beta H_n^L q_n
\end{equation}`





---

## General Equilibrium 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Let's think about the equilibrium distribution of economic activity. 

Endogenous variables: `\(\{w_n, L_n, R_n, v_n, Q_n, q_n, \Phi_n^L, \Phi_n^R, A_n, B_n\}_{i=1}^{\mathbb{N}}\)`. 

Parameters: `\(\{\alpha, \beta, \kappa, \epsilon, \eta^A, \eta^B, \delta^A, \delta^B\}\)`.

Geography: `\(\{\tau_{ij}, \bar{A}_n, \bar{B}, H_n^R, H_n^L\}\)`

To pin down the equilibrium we need ten equations. 

Let's assume that all the parameters and the geography are known. 


---

## General Equilibrium 

For each location `\(n\)`, we have that 

(1) Residents: `\(R_n = \xi \left( B_n \left( \Phi^R_n \right)^{\frac{1}{\epsilon}} Q_n^{\alpha - 1} \right)^{\epsilon}\)`

(2) Residence commuter MA: `\(\Phi^R_n = \frac{1}{\xi} \sum_{i \in \mathbb{N}} e^{-\kappa \epsilon \tau_{ni}} L_i \left( \Phi^L_i \right)^{-1}\)`

(3) Workers: `\(L_n = \xi \left( w_n \left( \Phi^L_n \right)^{\frac{1}{\epsilon}} \right)^{\epsilon}\)`

(4) Worker commuter MA: `\(\Phi^L_n = \frac{1}{\xi} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{N}} e^{-\kappa \epsilon \tau_{ni}} R_i \left( \Phi^R_i \right)^{-1}\)`

(5) Nominal wages: `\(w_n = A_n^{\frac{1}{\beta}} q_n^{-\left(\frac{1 - \beta}{\beta}\right)}\)`

(6) Per capita earnings: `\(\Phi^R_n v_n = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{N}} e^{-\kappa \epsilon \tau_{ni}} (w_i)^{\epsilon + 1}\)`

(7) Residential floor space: `\(Q_n = (1 - \alpha) v_n R_n (H^R_n)^{-1}\)`


---

## General Equilibrium 


(8) Commercial floor space: `\(q_n = A_n \left( \frac{L_n}{\beta} \right)^{\beta} \left( \frac{H^L_n}{1 - \beta} \right)^{-\beta}\)`

(9) Amenities: `\(B_n = \bar{B}_n \left( \sum_{i \in \mathcal{N}} e^{-\delta^B \tau_{ni}} R_i \right)^{\eta^B}\)`

(10) Productivities: `\(A_n = \bar{A}_n \left( \sum_{i \in \mathcal{N}} e^{-\delta^A \tau_{ni}} L_i \right)^{\eta^A}\)`

This gives us `\(10 \times \mathbb{N}\)` equations to pin down `\(10 \times \mathbb{N}\)` equations. 





---

## General Equilibrium 

The equilibrium can be written as a system of equations as follows 
`\begin{equation}
x_{nh} = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{N}} \kappa_{nih} \prod_{h' \in \mathcal{H}} x_{ih'}^{\gamma_{nhh'}},
\end{equation}`
where `\(h\in\mathbb{H}\)` denotes economic interactions and `\(n\in \mathbb{N}\)` locations.

`\(\kappa_{nih}\)` is a "kernel" that incorporates bilateral frictions.

In our example, `\(\mathbb{H} = 1, ..., 10\)` and `\(\mathbb{N}\)` is the number of blocks.

This is very convenient because we can characterize the equilibrium (existence, uniqueness) using results in Allen, Arkolakis, and Li (2024).

The properties of the equilibrium is governed by the coefficient matrix `\(\gamma_{nhh'}\)`.
- Spectral radius of the coefficient matrix is less than one.
- Then there exists a simple interative aglorithm that can be used to solve the system.

&lt;!-- We can also characterize when we can solve the model using a simple iterative procedure.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- intutiively it again boils down to a version of weak aglomeration forces relative to dispersion.  --&gt;

## Applications and Extensions

There are several applications of the model in the literature:
- Quantifying agglomeration spillovers
- Counterfactual exercises
- Decomposing variation in the spatial distribution of economic activity into various components.

&lt;br&gt;

Several potential extensions (see syllabus)
- Floor space supply elasticities
- Goods trade assumptions
- Worker heterogeneity and sorting
- Dynamics
- Normative questions
- Consumption market access

## Application 1



---

## The Economics of Density - Ahlfeldt et al. (2016) 

**Key challenge**: distinguishing agglomeration and dispersion forces from variation in locational fundamentals.

The main contribution of the paper is to estimate agglomeration economies flexibly.  

It does this in three steps:

- The paper develops a quantitative model of internal city structure with agglomeration and dispersion forces and an arbitrary number of heterogeneous city blocks.  

- Estimates the reduced form impact of the division of Berlin on the location of economic activity.

- Estimation uses data on thousands of Berlin city blocks (1936, 1986, 2006) together with exogenous variation from the city's division and reunification.  

Results reveal substantial, highly localised production and residential externalities.  

The model, with estimated agglomeration parameters, reproduces observed changes in city structure both qualitatively and quantitatively.

---

## Model setup

The model consists of a set of discrete blocks indexed by `\(i = 1, ..., S\)`. 

**Workers**: The utility is given by `\(u_{ijo} = \frac{z_{ijo}B_iw_jQ_i^{\beta-1}}{d_{ij}}\)`

**Production**: Production in block `\(j\)` is given by `\(y_j = A_jH_{Mj}^{\alpha}L_{Mj}^{1-\alpha}\)`

**Floor space**: Floor space is produced using capital and land `\(L_i = \xi_iQ_i\)`

**Floor prices**: Equal subject friction `\(q_i = \xi_iQ_i\)`

**Agglomeration economies**: `\(A_j = a_j \mathcal{Y}_j\)` where `\(\mathcal{Y}_j = \sum_{s\in S}e^{-\delta \tau_{ij}}\frac{H_{Ms}}{K_s}\)`

**Amenities**: `\(B_i = b_i \Omega_j\)` where `\(\Omega_i = \sum_{s\in S}e^{-\rho \tau_{ij}}\frac{H_{Rs}}{K_s}\)`

The spatial equilibrium is a trade-off between agglomeration economies (productivity + amenities) and demand for land.


---

## Reduced form analysis 

They begin the analysis by estimating the impact of being close to the division line on subsequent urban development. 

They estimate a version of the following equation
`\begin{equation}
\Delta \ln O_i = \alpha + \sum_{k\in K} \mathbb{I}_{ik} + \ln M_i\gamma + u_i
\end{equation}`
where `\(O_i\)` denotes an economic outcome (employment, land price, residents, etc.)

`\(\mathbb{I}_{ik}\)` is an indicator variable for whether block `\(i\)` lies within a distance grid cell `\(k\)` from the pre-war CBD.

`\(M_i\)` denotes time-invariant block-level controls.

---

## Counterfactuals - Exogenous Location Characteristics 

They consider first a version of the model with exogenous location characteristics only. 

They calibrate the model by combining parameters from the model with estimates of the gravity equation. 
- `\(\varepsilon = 6.83\)`
- `\(\kappa = 0.01\)`
- `\(1-\beta = 0.25\)`
- `\(1-\alpha = 0.2\)`
- `\(1-\mu = 0.25\)`

The authors then simulate the impact of the Berlin wall and re-estimate the reduced form on the simulated data. 



---

## 

&lt;img src="images/reg_3_berlin.png" style="width:55%; height:auto; display:block; margin:auto;" /&gt;



---

## Structural Estimation

The authors then estimate the full model with endogenous spillovers using a GMM approach. 

Obtain closed-form solutions for adjusted fundamentals in terms of the observed data and parameters
`\begin{equation}
\Delta \ln \left( \frac{\tilde{a}_{it}}{\tilde{a}_{t}} \right) 
= (1-\alpha)\Delta \ln\left( \frac{\mathbb{Q}_{it}}{\mathbb{Q}_{t}} \right) +\frac{\alpha}{\varepsilon}\Delta\ln \left(\frac{\omega_{it}}{\bar{\omega}_t}\right) - \lambda\Delta\ln\left(\frac{\Upsilon_{it}}{\bar{\Upsilon}_{it}}\right)
\end{equation}`
`\begin{equation}
\Delta \ln\!\left( \frac{\tilde{b}_{it}}{\tilde{b}_{t}} \right)= \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\,\Delta \ln\!\left( \frac{H_{Rit}}{H_{Rt}} \right)+ (1-\beta)\,\Delta \ln\!\left(\frac{\mathbb{Q}_{it}}{\mathbb{Q}_{t}} \right)- \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\,\Delta \ln\!\left( \frac{W_{it}}{W_{t}} \right)- \eta\,\Delta \ln\!\left( \frac{\Omega_{it}}{\Omega_{t}} \right),
\end{equation}`
All the variables on the left-hand side can be measured directly or calculated from observed data.

The authors use these equations to construct moments to estimate the parameters of the model.



---

## Moments and identification

The identification rests on the following moment equations
`\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}\!\left[ I_k \times \Delta \ln(\tilde{a}_{it} / \tilde{a}_{t}) \right] = 0, \qquad k \in \{1, \ldots, K_{\mathbb{I}}\},
\end{equation}`
`\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}\!\left[ I_k \times \Delta \ln(\tilde{b}_{it} / \tilde{b}_{t}) \right] = 0, \qquad k \in \{1, \ldots, K_{\mathbb{I}}\},
\end{equation}`
where `\(k\)` denotes the distance grid cells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


**Key assumption:** 

- The systematic change in the gradient of economic activity in West Berlin relative to the pre-war CBD following division is explained by the mechanisms of the model.

- Not by systematic changes in the pattern of structural residuals.

- Division driven by global geopolitical changes, not internal fundamentals across neighborhoods in Berlin.

- They use some additional moment conditions in the main approach.

&lt;!-- 51 Since Berlin’s division stemmed from military considerations during the Second World War and its reunification originated in the wider collapse of Communism, the resulting changes in the surrounding concentration of economic activity are plausibly exogenous to changes in adjusted production and residential fundamentals in West Berlin blocks --&gt;



---

## Estimation

The set of parameters they estimate are `\(\Lambda = \{\upsilon, \varepsilon, \lambda, \eta, \delta, \rho\}\)`. 

Stacking the sample equivalent of the moment conditions gives
`\begin{equation}
\mathbb{M}\left(\Lambda\right) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N m\left(\mathbf{X}_i, \Lambda\right) = 0,
\end{equation}`
where `\(N\)` is the sample size. The GMM estimate `\(\hat{\Lambda}\)` is the one that minimizes
`\begin{equation}
\hat{\Lambda} = \text{arg min} \left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N m\left(\mathbf{X}_i, \Lambda\right)^{\prime}\right)\mathbb{W}\left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N m\left(\mathbf{X}_i, \Lambda\right)\right),
\end{equation}`
where `\(\mathbb{W}\)` is a weighting matrix.

---

## Conclusion

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The key takeaways:

- A quantitative theoretical model of city structure that incorporates agglomeration and dispersion forces, allows for asymmetries in locational fundamentals.

- Combine the model with the exogenous source of variation in the surrounding concentration of economic activity provided by Berlin’s division and reunification

- When productivity and amenities are exogenous, the model is unable to account quantitatively for the observed treatment effects of division and reunification.

## Neighborhood Effects: Evidence from Wartime Destruction in London


What explains large differences in property prices and socioeconomic outcomes across locations?

Two competing mechanisms:

- **Location fundamentals:** amenities (green space, views) increase desirability.

- **Neighborhood effects:** residents influence each other (behavior, composition); small interventions can shift outcomes by changing who lives there.

Redding and Sturm (2024) combine granular data from London with a quantitative urban model. 
- Reduced-form evidence suggesting bombing affects amenities + neighborhood effects
- Use a quantitative urban model to measure amenities and spillovers
- Identify the impact of neighborhood effects on amenities using a "natural experiment"

---

## Reduced-Form Evidence

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

To explore the spatial distribution of bombing, they estimate the following regression 
`\begin{equation}
Y_{it} = \beta D_{it} + \varrho_k + u_{it},
\end{equation}`
where `\(i\)` denotes output area and `\(k\)` denotes grid-cell.  

- `\(D_{it}\)` is an indicator for the neighborhood being bombed during World War 2.

- Standard errors are clustered at the grid-cell level. 

- They consider a range of pre- and post-war outcomes.

## Quantitative Model

The basic structure of the model is as follows:

- `\(\mathbb{N}\)` neighborhoods indexed by `\(n\)` and `\(i\)`.  

- There are three socioeconomic groups: `\(o\in\{L, M, H\}\)`.

- Preferences: `\(u_{ni}^{o}(\omega) = \frac{B_n^{o} b_{ni}^{o}(\omega)w_i^{o}}{\kappa_{ni}^{o}P_n^{\alpha^{o}}Q_n^{1-\alpha^{o}}}\)`

- Technology: `\(1 = \frac{1}{A_{it}} \mathbb{W}_{it}^{\beta}q_{it}^{1-\beta}\)` where `\(W_{it}= \left[\left( \frac{w^{L}_{it}}{\gamma^{L}} \right)^{1-\sigma}+ \left( \frac{w^{M}_{it}}{\gamma^{M}} \right)^{1-\sigma}+ \left( \frac{w^{H}_{it}}{\gamma^{H}}\right)^{1-\sigma}\right]^{\frac{1}{1-\sigma}}\)`

- Both amenities and production spillovers are modeled in a standard manner.



---

## Model calibration

The authors calibrate the model in several steps. 

- Choose parameters from the literature (expenditure shares, etc.)

- Estimate the gravity equation for commuting.

Then they use the model to quantify the local amenities of each location.
`\begin{equation}
\ln B^{o}_{nt} = \ln\left(\frac{U_t^o}{\delta^o}\right) + \frac{1}{\epsilon^o}\ln(\lambda_{nt}^{Ro}) + (1-\alpha^o)\ln\left(Q_{nt}\right) - \ln RMA^{0}_{nt}
\end{equation}`
where `\(RMA^{0}_{nt}=\left[\sum_{\ell \in \mathbb{N}}\left( w^{0}_{\ell t} \right)^{\varepsilon^{0}}\tau_{n\ell t}^{-\phi^{0}}\right]^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{0}}}\)`.

They use this to solve for neighborhood amenities.

## Conclusion 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Find a large and persistent impact of wartime destruction on the location of economic activity in London. 

They use a model to measure residential amenities and 

The authors present evidence that this is driven by sorting and changes in residential amenities. 

The model with spillovers is able to quantitatively account for the reduced form findings.

A broader implication is that place-based interventions can have lasting effects on the spatial distribution of economic activity within cities.

&lt;!-- &lt;!-- In what follows, I introduce the basics of the spatial model of Allen and Arkolakis 2014. --&gt;

&lt;!-- There are `\(R\)` regions indexed by `\(i\)` or `\(j\)` (e.g. states, municipalities, or counties).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; --&gt;

&lt;!-- Regions differ in their productivity: `\(\large \mathcal{A}=\{\bar{A}_i\}_{i=1}^R\normalsize\)`. --&gt;

&lt;!-- - &lt;small&gt; Different inate characteristics that make it more or less suitable for production.&lt;/small&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; --&gt;

&lt;!-- And their amenities: `\(\large \mathcal{u}=\{\bar{u}_i\}_{i=1}^R\normalsize\)`.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- - &lt;small&gt; Some regions are nicer to live than others (e.g. natural amenities). &lt;/small&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; --&gt;

&lt;!-- Trade between regions are subject to iceberg trade costs: `\(\large \mathcal{T}=\{\tau_{ij}\}_{i,j\in R}\normalsize\)` where `\(\tau_{ij}\geq 1\)`. --&gt;

&lt;!-- - &lt;small&gt; For one unit to arrive in `\(j\)`, `\(\tau_{ij}\)` units must be shipped from `\(i\)`. &lt;/small&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; --&gt;
