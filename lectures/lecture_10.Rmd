## What is an interest rate?

Assume you borrow some amount from a bank. 

The interest rate is then 

$$ i = \frac{\text{amount to repay}}{\text{amount borrowed}} - 1$$

Why do you have to pay interest to borrow? 

- Banks borrow and lend money on the money market. 

- Money in the future might be worth less due to inflation. 

- The bank could have invested the amount in stocks or bonds.

- Risk of the loan not being repaid.
