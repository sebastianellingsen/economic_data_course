# Measuring Well-being



---

## What is wellbeing?

The utility of an individual can be thought of as the indirect utility function:
\begin{equation}
u_i\left(p, w \right),
\end{equation}
where $p$ denotes market prices and $w$ endowments.<br><br>

For a society of $n$ individuals, aggregate well-being can be formulated as
\begin{equation}
W = F(u_1, ..., u_n).
\end{equation}

- No agreement on appropriate term of $u_i$.

- No agreement on the measurement of these concepts.

- No agreement on how to aggregate utility function $F(\cdot)$.

## What is wellbeing?

Even if we agree on an appropriate term of $u_i$, how do we aggregate them?

- Utilitarian: $W = \sum_{i=1}^n u_i$.

- Rawls: utility of the worst off $W = \text{min}\{ u_1, ..., u_n\}$.

- Average utility: $W = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{n}u_i$.<br><br>

Well-being linked to availability of resources in numerous ways (GDP as welfare measure often motivated in this way). 


---



## GDP per capita is not a measure of well-being

It is a measure of certain types of economic activity. 

Ignores non-market activity that could be important. 

- Natural amenities, education, health, crime, cultural activities, safety.

GDP is correlated with a lot of *good stuff*.

- E.g. higher GDP associated with lower infant mortality rates

It is a measure of certain types of economic activity.

## GDP does not measure income distribution

Who gets the growth?

- Uneven benefits of growth.

- Skill-biased technological change.

- What is our welfare function?

- Utilitarian: $W = \sum_{i=1}^n u_i$.

- Rawls: utility of the worst off $W = \text{min}\{ u_1, ..., u_n\}$.

- Average utility: $W = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{n}u_i$.

## Summary

GDP is the most publicized economic data. 

- GDP measures economic activity in terms of expenditures, production or income.

- GDP is based on the national accounts.

- There are international standards for what is included in GDP.

- GDP is used for measuring economic growth, defining business cycles, measuring productivity, measuring wellbeing.<br><br> 

**Coming weeks**: How to measure welfare? Adjusting for prices (spatially and temporally): Real or nominal GDP?
