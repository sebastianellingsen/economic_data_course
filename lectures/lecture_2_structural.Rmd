## Quantitative Regional Economics

What governs the *distribution of economic activity* across regions?

First-Nature Geography
- Physical characteristics: forests, coasts, mountains, natural resources  
- Endowments that shape where activity *can* take place  

Second-Nature Geography 
- Agglomeration economies  
- Dispersion forces: fixed non-tradable factors, congestion, local externalities  
- Linkages across locations:  
  - Access to goods, labor, and migration opportunities  
- The equilibrium between *agglomeration* and *dispersion* determines spatial outcomes  


How can we incorporate all these forces into *tractable, quantitative models*?

# A Benchmark Model



---

## Geography

<!-- In what follows, I introduce the basics of the spatial model of Allen and Arkolakis 2014. -->

There are $R$ regions indexed by $i$ or $j$ (e.g. states, municipalities, or counties).<br><br>

Regions differ in their productivity: $\large \mathcal{A}=\{\bar{A}_i\}_{i=1}^R\normalsize$.

- <small> Different inate characteristics that make it more or less suitable for production.</small> <br><br>

And their amenities: $\large \mathcal{u}=\{\bar{u}_i\}_{i=1}^R\normalsize$. 

- <small> Some regions are nicer to live than others (e.g. natural amenities). </small> <br><br>

Trade between regions are subject to iceberg trade costs: $\large \mathcal{T}=\{\tau_{ij}\}_{i,j\in R}\normalsize$ where $\tau_{ij}\geq 1$.

- <small> For one unit to arrive in $j$, $\tau_{ij}$ units must be shipped from $i$. </small> <br><br>



---

## Demand 

Utility is derived from consumption in region $i$ is defined over differentiated varieties and local amenities $u_i$:
\begin{equation}
\large W_{i} =  \left(\sum_{j\in R} c_{ji}^{\frac{\sigma-1}{\sigma}}\right)^{\frac{\sigma}{\sigma-1}}u_i.\normalsize
\end{equation}
where $c_{ji}$ denotes the amount of the $j$ good consumed in $i$ and $u_i$ denote amenities. 

Each location produces a unique good (the Armington assumption).

The demand function for $c_{ji}$ is given by $c_{ji} = p_{ij}^{-\sigma}P_i^{\sigma-1}y_i$

- Note that: $\frac{\partial\ln(c_{ji}\mathbin{/}c_{ki})}{\partial\ln(p_{ji}\mathbin{/}p_{ki})} = \sigma$.

Why CES? Simple and tractable (homothetic), nests other demand systems (such as Cobb-Douglas).




---

## Amenities 

Regions might differ in other ways that matter for utility than real wages 

- Exogenous factors (e.g. natural beauty, temperature).

- Endogenous factors that are a function of population size (e.g. congestion, green space). <br><br>

We will capture both of these factors in a very simple reduced form manner:
\begin{equation}
\large u_i = \bar{u}_iL_i^{\beta},\normalsize
\end{equation}
where $L_i$ denotes the number of people in $i$. 


---


## Labour mobility 

The utility attained by a consumer in location $i$ is given by: 
\begin{equation}
\large V_{i} = \frac{y_i}{P_i} \bar{u}_iL_i^{\beta}.\normalsize
\end{equation}

Migration is frictionless in the basic case and the model is static.

We assume that people move across locations until utility is equalized: 
\begin{equation}
\large \bar{V} = V_{i} \text{ }\forall \text{ } i.\normalsize
\end{equation}
This will be our first notion of *spatial equilibrium* (a non-arbitrage condition across regions).

We assume that we are in this spatial equilibrium and don't model transitional dynamics. 





---

## Supply 

There is a large number of firms producing the location specific good $q_i$ with the following technology
\begin{equation}
\large q_i = A_i L_i.\normalsize
\end{equation}

We assume that there is perfect competition in each location: $p_j = \frac{w_j}{A_j}$.

Since there are iceberg trade costs, for one unit to arrive in location $i$, $\tau_{ji}$ must be shipped.

The price for the $j$ good in location $i$ is therefore
\begin{equation}
\large p_{ji} = \tau_{ji} \frac{w_j}{A_j}.\normalsize
\end{equation}
All people in $i$ supply one unit of labour inelastically.



---

## Productivity 

Just like with amenities, regions can differ in their productivity. 

- Exogenous factors (e.g. location fundamentals, natural resources).

- Endogenous factors that are a function of population size (e.g. agglomeration economies). <br><br>

We assume that the location productivity takes the following form:  
\begin{equation}
\large A_i = \bar{A}_iL_i^{\alpha},\normalsize
\end{equation}
where $\bar{A}_i$ is exogenous. 


---

## Trade 

Consumers maximize utility subject to their income $y_i$: 
\begin{equation}
\pi_{ji} =\left(\frac{p_{ji}}{P_{i}}\right)^{1-\sigma} (\text{exp. share}),
\end{equation}
where $P_{i} = \left(\sum_{j\in R} p_{ji}^{1-\sigma}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\sigma}}$ (the ideal price index in $i$).

Then the value of goods shipped from $j$ to $i$ is 
\begin{equation}
X_{ji} = \pi_{ji} Y_i = \pi_{ji} L_i y_i = \pi_{ji} L_i w_i,
\end{equation}
where $Y_i$ is the total income in region $i$.

It follows that 
\begin{equation}
X_{ji} = \tau_{ji}^{1-\sigma} \left(\frac{w_j}{A_j}\right)^{1-\sigma} P_i^{\sigma-1} L_i w_i.
\end{equation}
Which is a gravity equation for trade. 

INTUTION ELASTICITY

---

## Equilibrium 

The equilibrium is an allocation of populations and wages such that, 

1. Goods market clearing: $w_iL_i = \sum_{j=1}^RX_{ij}$

2. Balanced trade:  $w_iL_i = \sum_{j=1}^RX_{ji}$ 

3. Welfare is equalized across locations: $V_i=\bar{V}$ for all $i$.



---
## Equilibrium 

We can combine the equilibrium conditions into the following two equations.

By combining the goods market clearing, indirect utility and full labour mobility condition: 

\begin{equation}
\large w_i^{\sigma} L_i^{1+(1-\sigma)\alpha} = \bar{V}^{1-\sigma} \sum_{j\in R} \tau_{ij}^{1-\sigma} \bar{A}_i^{\sigma-1}w_j^{\sigma}\bar{u}_j^{\sigma-1}L_j^{1+\beta(\sigma-1)}\normalsize 
\end{equation}
By combining the price index/balanced trade condition and indirect utility: 
\begin{equation}
\large w_i^{1-\sigma} L_i^{(1-\sigma)\beta}=  \bar{V}^{1-\sigma} \sum_{j\in R}\tau_{ji}^{1-\sigma}\bar{u}_i^{\sigma-1} \bar{A}_j^{\sigma-1}L_j^{(\sigma-1)\alpha}w_j^{1-\sigma} \normalsize 
\end{equation}
An equilibrium, $\{L_i, w_i\}_{i=1}^R$ therefore solves the $2\times R$ equations above.

This is very complicated, but assuming that trade costs are symmetric (quasi-symmetric), we can simplify it. 


---
## Equilibrium 

Specifically, Allen and Arkolakis (2014) show that the origin and destination term is equal up to scale when the trade costs are symmetric. 

This means that 
\begin{equation}
\large w_i^{1-\sigma} A_i^{\sigma-1} =\phi P_i^{\sigma-1} L_i w_i\Rightarrow\normalsize 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\large w_i = \phi \bar{V}^{\tilde{\sigma}}\bar{A}_i^{\tilde{\sigma}}L_i^{\tilde{\sigma}(\frac{1}{1-\sigma}+\alpha-\beta)}\bar{u}_i^{-\tilde{\sigma}}\normalsize 
\end{equation}
So $w_i$ is just a function of the geography and the population size. 

We can use this to eliminate $w_i$ in the equilibrium conditions on the previous slide.

This greatly simplifies the solution and characterization of the equilibrium. 


---
## Equilibrium 

The equilibrium can then be reduced to 
\begin{equation}
\large L_i^{\tilde{\sigma}\gamma_1} = \phi^{\prime} \bar{A}_i^{\tilde{\sigma}(\sigma-1)}\bar{u}_i^{\tilde{\sigma}\sigma}  \sum_{j\in R}\tau_{ji}^{1-\sigma} \bar{A}_j^{\tilde{\sigma}\sigma}\bar{u}_j^{\tilde{\sigma}(\sigma-1)} \left(L_j^{\tilde{\sigma}\gamma_1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_1}}, \normalsize 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\large w_i = \phi \bar{V}^{\tilde{\sigma}}\bar{A}_i^{\tilde{\sigma}}L_i^{\tilde{\sigma}(\frac{1}{1-\sigma}+\alpha-\beta)}\bar{u}_i^{-\tilde{\sigma}},\normalsize 
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{\sigma} = \frac{1-\sigma}{1-2\sigma}$, $\gamma_1 = 1-\alpha(\sigma-1)-\beta\sigma$, and $\gamma_2 =  1+ \beta(\sigma-1) +\alpha\sigma$. 

Theorem 2 in Allen and Arkolakis (2014) states that when $\gamma_2/\gamma_1\in[-1,1]$ then an equilibrium exists and is unique.

Therefore, an equilibrium exists and is unique when the dispersion force is large relative to the agglomeration force.

## Example: Simple model 

Let's consider 900 places equally spaced on a grid 10km apart.

$u$ is drawn from a distribution.

$A$ forms a "city".

<!-- trade costs are ...  -->

We set $\sigma = 5$, $\alpha=0.5$, $\beta=-0.3$.

## Taking the model to the data 

So what do we need to use this model for study counterfactuals in real data. 

We need estimates of the structural parameters. 

How do we recover recovering model fundamentals $\mathcal{u}$ and $\mathcal{A}$?

If we have data on $\{L\}_{i=1}^R$ and $\{w\}_{i=1}^R$ as is often the case, we can *invert* the model.

This means solving for $\mathcal{u}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ that rationalizes $\{L\}_{i=1}^R$ and $\{w\}_{i=1}^R$ as an equilibrium. 

This is a good starting point for a counterfactual exercise. 




---

## Model inversion

How is this done in practice? Remember our equilibrium conditions:

\begin{equation}
\large L_i^{\tilde{\sigma}\gamma_1} = \phi^{\prime} \bar{A}_i^{\tilde{\sigma}(\sigma-1)}\bar{u}_i^{\tilde{\sigma}\sigma}  \sum_{j\in R}\tau_{ji}^{1-\sigma} \bar{A}_j^{\tilde{\sigma}\sigma}\bar{u}_j^{\tilde{\sigma}(\sigma-1)} \left(L_j^{\tilde{\sigma}\gamma_1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_1}}, \normalsize 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\large w_i = \phi \bar{V}^{\tilde{\sigma}}\bar{A}_i^{\tilde{\sigma}}L_i^{\tilde{\sigma}(\frac{1}{1-\sigma}+\alpha-\beta)}\bar{u}_i^{-\tilde{\sigma}},\normalsize 
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{\sigma} = \frac{1-\sigma}{1-2\sigma}$, $\gamma_1 = 1-\alpha(\sigma-1)-\beta\sigma$, and $\gamma_2 =  1+ \beta(\sigma-1) +\alpha\sigma$. 

Notice, by using the wage equation, we can eliminate $\mathcal{u}$ in the first equation. 

This then becomes a function of only $\mathcal{A}$, $\{L\}_{i=1}^R$ and $\{w\}_{i=1}^R$.

We can use this to solve for $\mathcal{A}$ and then the wage equation to solve for $\mathcal{u}$.

<!-- INSERT SOLUTION HERE  -->

## Summary

Summary, simple model, but tractable and allows a realistic geography, and we can do interesting counterfactuals 

There are several extensions to the framework that are easy to incorporate. 

We will turn to this next.

## What is the Costs of Remoteness?

What explains the huge variation in economic development across countries and regions?  

Redding and Sturm (2008) study how a location’s remoteness (market access) affects economic development.

The challenge is that market access both influences and is influenced by development:

- Remoteness may correlate with unobserved factors like endowments or institutions.

- Development itself can reduce remoteness via infrastructure investment.

Thus, cross-sectional comparisons are problematic, since cities differ in many confounding ways beyond remoteness.<br><br>

$\Rightarrow$ Use Germany’s division and 1990 reunification as exogenous shocks to identify the causal impact of market access on economic development.

---

## A "Natural Experiment" 

Main idea: West German cities close to the new border experienced a disproportionate loss of market access relative to other West German cities.

There are several compelling features: 

- No institutional variation: Treatment and control cities share the same country and institutions.

- Stable endowments: Natural endowments are constant over time.

- Large shock: German division caused an unusually large change in market access, observed over decades.

- Exogenous border: The East–West border was drawn for military reasons, unrelated to prewar city traits.<br><br>

$\Rightarrow$ These features allow us to isolate the causal effect of market access on economic development.










---


## The Model  

**Geography:**  

- Fixed number $c\in\{1, \dots, C\}$, each with an exogenous stock of a non-tradeable amenity $H_c$.  

- Mass $L$, mobile workers across cities, each endowed with $1$ unit of labor.

- To deliver **1 unit** from city $i$ to city $c$, $T_{ic} > 1$ units must be shipped. 

**Consumers:**  

- Share $\mu$ of expenditure on differentiated tradeable varieties with elasticity of substitution $\sigma$.
  
**Production Technology:**

  - Each tradeable variety requires a fixed cost and a constant marginal cost of labor.
  
  - Labor is the only factor of production.

**Market Structure:**  

  - Tradeable varieties are produced under monopolistic competition.






---

### City Size in Equilibrium 

Workers move until real wages are equalized across all populated cities.  

The equilibrium condition is therefore given by 

\begin{equation}
\large \omega_c = \frac{w_c}{P_{Mc}^{\mu}P_{Hc}^{1-\mu}} = \omega \text{ }\forall \text{ }c\in C. \normalsize
\end{equation}

- $w_c$: nominal wage in city $c$. 

- $P_c$: price index for tradeable varieties.  

- $H_c$: price of the nontradeable amenity. <br><br>


Assume $\omega_i > \omega_j$. What what are the underlying economic forces leading to adjustment? 




---

### Market Access and City Size

Redding and Sturm rewerite the equilibrium population size in terms of firm and consumer market access: 
\begin{equation}
\large L_c = \xi \left(FMA_c\right)^{\frac{\mu}{\sigma(1-\mu)}} \left(CMA_c\right)^{\frac{\mu}{\sigma(1-\mu)(\sigma-1)}} H_c\normalsize
\end{equation}
where $\xi$ is a function of parameters and the common real wage $\omega$ and parameters. <br><br>

$FMA_c = \sum_{i\in C} (w_i L_i)^{1-\mu} \left(P_{iM}\right)^{\sigma-1} T_{ci}^{1-\sigma}$.

- Captures the proximity of firms to demand in all cities (home market effect + transport costs).<br>

$CMA_c = \sum_{i\in C} n_ip_i T_{ic}^{1-\sigma}$.

- Represents the “cost of living effect” — cities with high $CMA_c$ face lower tradeable prices.<br>

Congestion Effect: 

  - Driven by the limited stock of the non-tradeable amenity $H_c$.






---

### Model preidictions

Choose parameters from litearture

calibrate H to make the model exactly fit the population in .... 

Then simulate the model making trade csots very hgih

Two main impacts: 

- The first main prediction is that the imposition of the East-West border will result in a relocation of population from West German cities close to the new border to other West German cities.

- effects are larger for smaller cities

## Empirical Specification

Their baseline specification is the following regression 

\begin{equation}
\large \text{Popgrowth}_{ct} = \beta \text{Border}_c + \gamma (\text{Border}_c \times \text{Division}_t) + \delta_t + \varepsilon_{ct}.\normalsize
\end{equation}

- $\text{Popgrowth}_{ct}$: Annualized population growth in city $c$ at time $t$ (1919–1988).  

- $\text{Border}_c$: Indicator for cities $\leq75$ km from the East–West border. 

- $\text{Division}_t$: Equals $1$ during periods of German division.  

- $\delta_t$: Full set of time fixed effects.  

- Standard errors clustered at the city level. <br><br>

The parameter of interest is $\gamma$ which captures the differential impact of division on close and far away cities. 

- Model prediction is $\gamma>0$ and larger for the subsample of small cities. 

<!-- - $\gamma<0$, smaller for larger cities than for smaller cities, esitmate seprately for the two samples  -->

<!-- fix the specification  -->







<!-- can these forces account for the reduced form effect -->

<!-- what are the likely drivers here?  -->

<!-- what trade costs and agglomeration forces is it that matters here? add the expressions.  -->

## Mechanisms

Several potential mechanisms that could explain the findings: 

- War time related destruction. 

- Refugees from eastern Europe and Eastern Germany. 

- Improved integration of Western Germany. 

- Fear of further armed conflict. <br><br>

What remains plausible channels are changes in consumer and firm market access? 

- Are the reduced form magnitudes potentially explained by these channels? 

- Which mechanisms in the model are important?

## Conclusions


Exploits German division and reunification as a *natural experiment* to identify the causal effect of market access.

West German cities near the East-West border became economically peripheral after 1949.

These cities experienced a less population growth, especially smaller ones.

Effects match predictions from a quantitative spatial model.

<!-- Various checks rule out alternative explanations. -->

Supports a *causal relationship* between market access and the spatial distribution of economic activity.
