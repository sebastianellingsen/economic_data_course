## Working with data on inflation  

All statistical agencies collect data on prices and inflation.

- The primary reason is for monetary and fiscal policy. 

The most common approach is the **annual inflation rate**:

$$\pi_t = \frac{P_{t} - P_{t-12}}{P_{t-12}},$$
where $P_{t}$ is some price index at time $t$.

The annual inflation rate compares prices for the latest month with the same month a year ago.

- We can download data for the UK from the August 2023 report [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/august2023).
