# Style guide

To make the scripts understandable for other people and yourself, it is important to follow a few principles.

- Add comments in scripts. This is done with a $\texttt{#}$. R will ignore anything after a $\texttt{#}$.

- Names should be descriptive and meaningful. 

- Use underscore to separate words in a variable name of several words, not spaces.

- Add line breaks and avoid very long lines. 

- Variable and function names should be written in lowercase. 

- Avoid using names that are the same as existing variables.

- Add spacing between symbols such as $\texttt{+}$, $\texttt{=}$, and $\texttt{-}$.

- Vertically align some repetitive coding tasks.

- Always start the script by loading the dataset. 

- Never change the file containing raw data.

# Measuring Economic Activity



---


## GDP is Everywhere


- A measure of growth: Change in GDP.

- Define business cycles.

- In the European Union and the UK we typically define a recession as two successive quarters of negative economic growth.

- The US National Bureau of Economic Research has a \say{Business Cycle Dating Committee}.

- Measure inequality: Wage share.

- Measure productivity: GDP per worker.

- Proxy for well-being: GDP per capita (much more next week).



---

## Measuring Economic Activity


GDP, Gross Domestic Product, is the most frequently used indicator in the national accounts

- How does GDP measure economic activity?

- What are the main approaches to measuring GDP?

- How do we calculate the GDP of an economy?


---


## Total Value of Production

<!-- *GDP measures the value of all the output carried out by all the firms, non-profit, institutions, government bodies, and households in a given country during a given period.* -->

A simple measure would be the sum of the value of output for all firms:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i = 1}^N Y_{it}P_{it}.
\end{equation}

- where $N$ is the number of firms, $Y_{it}$ production, and $P_{it}$ the price.

- $N$ are all the firms within the country.

- $t$ refers to a year or a quarter. <br><br>

This is **not** how GDP is defined though. Why?

## A Very Simple Economy

      <td>Firm A2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Output</td>
      <td>$ 30,000</td>
      <td>$ 100,000</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br><br>
<!-- Firm A produces 100,000 worth of pasta in year 1.  -->

<!-- The firm splits into A1 and A2 in year 2 -->

<!-- - A1 produces 30,000 worth of flour. -->

<!-- - A2 buys it and sells total output for 100,000 -->

Total value of output increases to 130,000.

Splitting the firm increases GDP by $30$ percent!

<!-- The same quantity of pasta was produced at the same price. All that changed was the legal and commercial organisation of the firms. -->


---

## Measuring GDP

For this reason, we consider the sum of value added in the economy instead:
\begin{equation}
\text{GDP}_t = \sum_{i = 1}^N \text{Value added}_{it}
\end{equation}
where $\text{Value added}_{it}$ denotes the difference between value of output and inputs.

We measure the value that the firm adds to that of the firms that supply its inputs.

Why does this work?

<!-- GDP combines in a single figure, and with no double counting, all the output (or production) carried out by all the firms, non-profit, institutions, government bodies and households in a given country during a given period,  -->

<!-- regardless of the type of goods and services produced, provided that the production takes place within the countryâ€™s economic territory. -->

    </tr>

</table>

<br><br>

$GDP = 100,000$ in year $1$ and year $2$. 

GDP remains unchanged when the organization of the economy changes. 



---



## The Production Approach

The production approach defines GDP in the following manner, 
\begin{equation}
\text{GDP}_t^P = \sum_{i = 1}^N \text{Value added}_{it} + NT
\end{equation}
- where $N$ denotes the set of production entities in the economy (firms etc.) 

- $NT$ denotes taxes minus subsidies. 

- Crucially it avoids double counting 

- Why $NT$? Taxes are subtracted from value-added, and we need to adjust for this. 

- Can be split by industry (NAICS). More in the lab!


---


## The Production Boundary

How about $N$, what counts as economic activity? 

According to the ESA 2010 standards:

- Does the activity produce a useful output?

- Is the product or activity marketable and does it have a market value?

- If the product does not have a meaningful market value, can one be assigned (imputed)?

- Would exclusion (or inclusion) of the product of the activity make comparisons between countries over time more meaningful?

<br><br> Not always obvious what is accounted for in GDP and what is not. 

- Housework, voluntary work, and criminal activities fall outside. 

<!-- Economic activity within the country. GNI captures activity in other countries.  -->

<!-- Does not account for depreciation (net domestic product).  -->

---



## The Expenditure Approach

In the simple economy, all expenditure equals value added $\Rightarrow$ GDP equals expenditure on pasta.

In a real economy there are more ways to spend, this is the basis of the expenditure approach
\begin{equation}
\text{GDP}_t^E = C + I + G + Ex - Im
\end{equation}
- $C$ the final consumption expenditure of goods and services by households.

- $G$ is the final consumption expenditure of goods and services by the government.

- $I$ is investment (gross capital formation).

- $Ex$ are exports and $Im$ imports.





---


## The Income Approach

In the simple economy, income from pasta is the only income in the economy.  

In a bigger economy, it can be written 
\begin{equation}
\text{GDP}_t^I = W + P + NT
\end{equation}
- W denotes worker compensation 

- P denotes profits

- NT taxes minus subsidies



---

## Reconciling Output, Expenditure, and Income

Based on this discussion, the following identities must hold: <br><br> 

\begin{equation}
\text{GDP}_t^P  = \text{GDP}_t^E = \text{GDP}_t^I.
\end{equation}
<br><br>

- There are three different ways to measure GDP (output, expenditure, and income).

- In practice, we can use these different measures to decompose GDP. 

- E.g. to understand underlying drivers of changes in GDP growth.

## GDP in Volume

Does the increase in GDP stem from changes in quantity or prices? 

GDP at current prices can be adjusted using the following identity,
\begin{equation}
\text{GDP deflator}_t = 100\times \frac{\text{Nominal GDP}_t }{\text{Real GDP}_t } 
\end{equation}
- Note this is different from the CPI, not all goods in GDP are in the CPI.

- Very important to know if GDP is in volume or value. 

- Economists typically care about real GDP. However, value is often used to standardize different variables. <br><br> 

We will see much more on this later!

## What to use GDP for? 

Calculate the annual rate of growth of GDP: $g_t = \frac{Y_{it} - Y_{it-1}}{Y_{it-1}}$.

- This is most often done with real GDP.<br><br> 

Normalizing a variable by GDP: $x_{it} = \frac{X_{it}}{Y_{it}}$.

- E.g. government expenditure (typically done in current prices).<br><br> 


Calculating contributions to growth (expenditure approach): 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta GDP_t}{GDP_{t-1}} = \frac{C_{t-1}}{GDP_{t-1}} \frac{\Delta C_t}{C_{t-1}} + \frac{I_{t-1}}{GDP_{t-1}} \frac{\Delta I_t}{I_{t-1}} + \frac{G_{t-1}}{GDP_{t-1}} \frac{\Delta G_t}{G_{t-1}} + \frac{X_{t-1}}{GDP_{t-1}} \frac{\Delta X_t}{X_{t-1}} 
\end{equation}
- This breakdown of growth is widely used by macroeconomists.





---
## Contributions to Growth

GDP in the expenditure approach is defined as
\begin{equation}
GDP_t = C_t + I_t + G_t + X_t. 
\end{equation}
Taking the first difference gives
\begin{equation}
GDP_t - GDP_{t-1} = C_t - C_{t-1} + I_t - I_{t-1} + G_t - G_{t-1} + X_t - X_{t-1} = \Delta C_t + \Delta I_t + \Delta G_t + \Delta X_t.
\end{equation}
Dividing by $GDP_{t-1}$ gives 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta GDP_t}{GDP_{t-1}} = \frac{\Delta C_t}{GDP_{t-1}} + \frac{\Delta I_t}{GDP_{t-1}} + \frac{\Delta G_t}{GDP_{t-1}} + \frac{\Delta X_t}{GDP_{t-1}}.
\end{equation}
Multiplying and dividing each element by its value in the previous period gives the expression
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta GDP_t}{GDP_{t-1}} = \frac{C_{t-1}}{GDP_{t-1}} \frac{\Delta C_t}{C_{t-1}} + \frac{I_{t-1}}{GDP_{t-1}} \frac{\Delta I_t}{I_{t-1}} + \frac{G_{t-1}}{GDP_{t-1}} \frac{\Delta G_t}{G_{t-1}} + \frac{X_{t-1}}{GDP_{t-1}} \frac{\Delta X_t}{X_{t-1}} 
\end{equation}

- Enables us to explore the various components of GDP growth between two periods.

- Equals the rate of growth times the GDP share in the previous period.

## Limitations of GDP

Only captures some types of economic activity. 

- In developing countries with large informal sectors it can be a poor measure. <br><br> 


Often used as a measure of well-being:

- Ignores: nature, climate, education, health, crime, cultural activities, safety.

- GDP is correlated with many of these measures.

- Does not measure non-market transactions.

- E.g. higher GDP is associated with lower infant mortality rates.<br><br> 


We will explore these issues more in detail next week.

## Why "GDP"?

**Gross**: Depreciation of its fixed capital goods not deducted.

- Net domestic product (NDP) is a country's gross domestic product (GDP) minus depreciation on its capital goods.<br><br> 

**Domestic**: Gross value added inside the country. 

- GNI measures the value produced by the citizens of a country.  

- For large economies GNI and GDP are similar.<br><br> 

**Product**: Refers to production.
 







---

## Summary

GDP is the most publicized economic data. 

- GDP measures economic activity in terms of expenditures, production or income.
